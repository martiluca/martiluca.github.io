Hi! I'm Martina Luc√†. I am currently a Scholarship Holder at ARC-NET Applied Research Center - Miriam Cherubini Loro, University of Verona.

Previously, I was a student of the Master's Degree in Molecular and Medical Biotechnology at the University of Verona.

During these studies I developed an interest for the field of Bioinformatics, especially applied to genomics.

My objective is to deepen my knowledge in this field, trying to combine my passion for Biology with the one for Computer Science.
