Hi! I'm Martina Luc√†. I am currently a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Verona. There, I'm working on developing and testing algorithms for computational biology and I will also work with variant calling applied to pangenomics. 

My journey started with a Bachelor's degree in biotechnology (University of Insubria, Varese (VA), Italy) and followed with a Master's degree in the same field (University of Verona, Verona (VR), Italy). After my Master's degree, I also got a Scholarship at ARC-NET Applied Research Center - Miriam Cherubini Loro (University of Verona).

This blog will contain everything I want to share during my journey of trying to connect my interest in biotechnology with computer science.
