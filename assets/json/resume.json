During this period, my interest in bioinformatics applied to genomics grew. I'm currently a Computer Science Ph.D. student working on developing and testing algorithms for computational biology. During my Ph.D. I will also work with variant calling applied to pangenomics. I want to continue to connect my interest in biology and my skills in computer science. I am proficient in Python and C++ and have experience working in remote bash shell environments.","location":{"postalCode":"37124","city":"Verona","countryCode":"IT","region":"Veneto"}},"education":[{"institution":"University of Verona","location":"Verona, Italy","url":"https://www.corsi.univr.it/?ent=cs&id=635&menu=home&lang=en","area":"Computer Science","studyType":"PhD","startDate":"2024-10","endDate":"2027-10"},{"institution":"PANGAIA","location":"Como, Italy","url":"https://copa24.pangenome.eu/","area":"Evolution in Computational Pangenomics","studyType":"Summer PhD School","startDate":"2024-09","endDate":"2024-09"},{"institution":"University of Verona","location":"Verona, Italy","url":"https://www.corsi.univr.it/?ent=cs&id=698","area":"Molecular and Medical Biotechnology","studyType":"Master's Degree","startDate":"2021-10","endDate":"2024-03","score":"110/110L","courses":["Parameters for Prefix-Free Parsing: Analysis and Experimentation"]},{"institution":"University of Granada","location":"Granada, Spain","studyType":"Erasmus+ Blended Intensive Program","startDate":"2023-01","endDate":"2023-04"},{"institution":"University of Insubria","location":"Varese, Italy","area":"Biotechnology","studyType":"Bachelor's Degree","startDate":"2017-10","endDate":"2021-03","score":"103/110","courses":["Bioarcheological analysis of the osteological finds from the crypt of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Vercelli"]},{"institution":"Liceo Paolo Giovio","location":"Como, Italy","area":"Scientific High School","studyType":"High School Diploma","score":"72/100","startDate":"2012-09","endDate":"2017-07"}],"work":[{"name":"Applied Research Center ARC-NET \"Miriam Cherubini Loro\"","position":"Research Fellow","startDate":"2023-10","endDate":"2024-10","summary":"During my fellowship under Prof. A.
